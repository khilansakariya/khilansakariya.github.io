Hello! I'm **Khilan Sakariya**, a professional freelance **English to Gujarati translator** based in Surat, India (also known as the Diamond City and Cleanest City of India!).

As a native **Gujarati** speaker and fluent in English and Hindi, I specialize in bridging language barriers. My expertise lies in providing high-quality **translation**, **localization**, **editing**, and **proofreading** services, primarily focusing on the **English to Gujarati (en-gu)** language pair. I work across various domains including technology, education, marketing, legal, and more, ensuring your content is not just translated, but culturally adapted for the target audience.

Throughout my career as a **Gujarati linguist**, I've had the privilege of collaborating with diverse clients like [Magnon Sancus](https://www.magnonsancus.com/), [Testbook](https://testbook.com/), and [Embibe](https://www.embibe.com/). My focus is always on delivering accurate, reliable, and timely **Gujarati translation** services that meet specific project requirements and exceed expectations. You can see some examples of my work in the [Projects section](#projects).

I am a dedicated professional with a strong work ethic, consistently striving for excellence in every **translation** task. Beyond technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities and effective project management capabilities.

Here are some of the key services I offer:
